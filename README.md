Computer vision empowers machines to interpret and understand the visual world. It encompasses techniques like image processing, feature detection, classification, and object recognition. Key libraries include OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Practical applications range from facial recognition and autonomous driving to medical imaging and augmented reality. Mastering computer vision involves learning algorithms, experimenting with data, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. Dive in and see where your creativity takes you!
